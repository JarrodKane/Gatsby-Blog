So this is a real entry, no test post here, no sir you won't see any Lorem ipsum on in this post baby.

### What did I make this site for?

Learning, I made this so that I would spend time building something that I would use on a weekly basis. \
This is a testing ground for me, as well as a great place to show off my projects.

### What's the site made with?

It's made with Gatsby js, has some cool react, and is hosted on netlify(Also netlify CMS, might change to markdown latter), if you're interested in looking into it more it's also public on my Github [Trojan-Cat](https://github.com/Trojan-Cat).

### What will this site be used for?

It'll be used for a dairy of sorts, documenting my learning journey. So in that case I might be popping in semi instructionals. Yes, you read that right, it's another damn site repeating the same stuff that you can find anywhere else on the web, but the main point of this is for my own learning so yeah...

This site might also have some posts not related to technical stuff, like MMA but on the whole I think I'll try to keep it very technology and development focused.





That's it for now, just keeping it short and sweet
